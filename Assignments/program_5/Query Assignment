1. Use clustering to find the top 5 clusters of volcanoes and/or earthquakes. Query to find which city is most central to each cluster. Route through airports from origin destination to each destination and then back home again for a World Disaster Tour. Use Indiana Jones Travel music

2. Find the volcanoes with the most number of earthquakes within X distance. Color code these areas red for high hazard. Find the volcanoes with the least number of earthquakes within X distance. Color code these areas blue for low hazard. Could add different color codes for zones inbetween the extremes.

3. User can click on world map to cause a natural disaster. The closest volcano erupts or earthquake (based on past earthquakes) occurs. The area around the disaster (X miles) becomes a different color (bounding box?). Lines drawn from cities within the disaster area indicate people fleeing to the closest airports not in the disaster area.
